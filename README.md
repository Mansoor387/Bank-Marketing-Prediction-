# ðŸ“Š Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction

This project predicts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a **term deposit** as a result of a marketing campaign.  
The dataset used is the [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  

We apply **classification models** and use **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods (SHAP & LIME) to interpret model predictions.
